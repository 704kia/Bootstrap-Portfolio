          <p>My name is Markia Hodge and I am an aspiring "Jack of all Trades."</p>

          <p>I take interest in many affairs and choose to take intitative in performing everything that catches my
            attention.
            So far, my curiosity has driven me to learn Photography, Accounting, Rollerskating, American Sign Language,
            Marketing, and now, the apple of my eye, Web Development.</p>

          <p>Web Development is far different from anything I've ever learned, as the field is continously changing.
            I focus more on Front End Development, as marketing and user experience are big takes for me.</p>

          <p>I dream of growing so much personally, spiritually, and emotionally that I feel 20 ft tall!</p>
